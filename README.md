## CheckPoint
CheckPoint is used as a scheduling tool to perform tasks and daily routines. We do not collect any personal information in the application. When performing a task, the user must sign the task from a list of user-made signatures, and this information is stored in the database indefinetly. However these signatures might be "John Smith" or "Station user 1", it is up to the user what the signatures are.

The application does track user behaviour using Visual Studio App Center where data is kept for 90 days to help us identify crashes and other problems with our application.
